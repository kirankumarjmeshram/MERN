The Content-Type header is an HTTP header that specifies the 
format of the data in the body of an HTTP request or response. 
It tells the receiving end how to interpret the data in the message body, 
so that it can properly handle the content

The Content-Type header is typically set by the client when making an 
HTTP request and by the server when sending an HTTP response. The value of the 
header indicates the media type of the content, such as text/html for HTML content, 
image/png for PNG images, or application/json for JSON data

The application media type is used for data that doesn't fit into any of the 
other well-known media types such as text, image, audio, or video.
